# verity.yaml — verity-specific configuration
#
# This file holds settings that belong neither in Copa's copa-config.yaml
# nor in the standard Helm Chart.yaml.

# Tag variant overrides for chart-sourced images.
# Key: partial image path to match. If an image ref contains this string
# and its tag ends with "-<from>", the tag suffix is replaced with "-<to>".
overrides:
  "timberio/vector":
    from: "distroless-libc"
    to: "debian"
